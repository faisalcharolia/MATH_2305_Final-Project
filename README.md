 UHD Weighted Graphs

### What is Weighted Graph?
* A graph weighted is a graph with a numerical weight for every section. Therefore, a weighted graph is a special category of graph in which the mark numbers (usually called positive) are displayed.

### Weighted graph algorithms with Python
* Graph algorithms are provided with python implementation. The minimum graphical interface and many groups that enforce this interface are specified. Any unsafe python artifacts may be graph nodes. The leading edges are type Edge examples. Graphs are graph level examples. It is based on the lists of neighboring images, but with a simple look-up of nodes and neighbors. It is also important for other implementations of this type.
* In this work, many algorithms are implemented using a unified approach. There are separate classes and modules devoted to different algorithms. Three algorithms for finding a minimum spanning tree are implemented: the Boruvka's algorithm, the Prim's algorithm (three implementations), and the Kruskal's algorithm. 
* In this Particular Project We use Prim's algorithms. *


#  Minimum Spanning Tree
 
   Given a connected, undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is subgraph that is tree and connects all the vertices together.
   A single graph can have many different spanning trees. We can also assign a weight to each edge, which is a number representing
   how unfavorable it is, and use this to assign a weight to a spanning tree by computing the sum of the weights of the edges in that spanning tree.
   A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is then a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight or
   every other spanning tree. More generally, any undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is union
    of minimum spanning trees for its connected components.
